👋 Hi, I’m @zorromuharoro!

I’m an Applied Electronics and Mechanical Systems Specialist with a strong background in electrical maintenance and repair. My expertise spans PCB design, troubleshooting complex electronic faults, developing automation systems, and optimizing industrial processes.

💻 I actively work with Python, Arduino, Raspberry Pi (4GB and 5th gen), and microcontrollers like ATtiny13A to build both hobby and advanced-level projects. I’m passionate about integrating smart systems and AI-driven automation technologies to revolutionize industrial workflows.

🛠️ On the mechanical side, I use SolidWorks and Geomagic Design X for detailed 3D modeling and prototyping. With my 3D printer and CNC router, I bring designs to life and iterate quickly on functional parts.

🌱 Currently, I’m deepening my Python programming skills and exploring VHDL to expand into hardware description languages. I also have experience with HTML and CSS, which supports my interest in web-based project development.

🤝 I’m eager to collaborate on:

Python software development

Embedded systems and Arduino projects

Industrial automation and system optimization

PCB design, assembly, and repair

Mechanical CAD design and rapid prototyping
