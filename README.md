👋 Hi, I’m @zorromuharoro
👀 I’m interested in Python, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing, CNC routers, electronic circuit design, microcontroller programming, HTML, CSS, and electrical maintenance/repair. I also use SolidWorks and Geomagic Design X.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I already know HTML and CSS, and I might learn VHDL in the future.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python software development, Arduino projects, and electronic circuit design.
